1. Download and open Analysis_full_spectrum_noW_remote_with_attenuator.ipynb as a jupyter notebook.
2. Give a correct path to the measurement Data files and the output folder and run the code. The simulated spectrum .npz arhive (produced by AmBe_GeSim_noW_remote/Analysis_GeSim_AmBe_remote_noW.ipynb) should be in the notebook folder.

It will plot the measured and simulated spectra along with discrepancy between them.
